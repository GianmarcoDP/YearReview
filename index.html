<h1> Year  Review</h1>
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <p>Quite honestly I only barely remember what has happened the past 6 months, let alone the past year. To be honest the only things I can think of that are noteworthy is like quarantine and weeb stuff, which is basically the only thing I actually will talk about. I did sort of get into political stuff but I seriously don't want to talk about that.</p>
    <h2>Highlights</h2>

      <p> i have become really addicted to Japanese Vtubers, essentially youtubers who use 2D avatars, who have become fairly popular lately. In partifcular the groups Hololive and Nijisanji, the group dynamics and the people behind them feel really genuine. Props to the translators who made the English speaking community possible too. </p>

      <p>I started reading a lot of manga. It is the byproduct of not wanting to wait for the next seasons of the animes Demonn Slayer and Kaguya-sama to come out. Sans the ones mentioned, some mangas I started reading  are ACT AGE, Chainsaw Man, Hinamatsuri, and Spy x Family</p>
